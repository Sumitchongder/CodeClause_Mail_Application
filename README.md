# Mail_Application: PyEmail
This is my Golden Project for Codeclause Internship. I have developed a Mail Application [PyEmail] with GUI in Python.

PyEmail is a lightweight and easy-to-use email application written in Python. 
This application allows users to send and receive emails with minimal setup required. 
PyEmail supports both SMTP and IMAP protocols and provides a simple, intuitive interface for composing and reading emails. 
The application also includes basic features such as the ability to attach files and manage multiple email accounts. 
PyEmail is designed to be simple and straightforward, making it perfect for those who need a no-fuss email client. 
Whether you're a beginner or a seasoned Python developer, PyEmail is the perfect solution for your basic email needs."
